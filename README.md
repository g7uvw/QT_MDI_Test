# QT_MDI_Test

This started as a minium workign example for a QT MDI aplication. It soon morphed into mutiple seperate windows after I realised I couldn't get exact mouse co-cordinated in an MDI window. Now it's just a place to hack on some ideas and test code before I integrate it into the actual application I'm working on.
